Module 4 - Land Cover Classification
------------------------------------

**What will you learn from this module?**


* Common methods using RS indices for supervised land cover classification (LCC)
* LCC systems
* Classify images in GEE 

1. Supervised Image Classification Methods
------------------------------------------

These methods identify spectrally similar areas on images by first identifying known classes from training sites and then directing the image processing using those training sites as reference for unknown sites. Following methods are commonly used for LCC:


* **Minimum-Distance to the Mean Classifier**\ : This technique calculates the mean point in digital parameter space, and uses multiple metrics such as Euclidean distance, normalized Euclidean distance, and Mahalanobis distance from that mean to classify unknown image data to known classes, as shown in the Figure below. Additional information is available `here <https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/larstech/25/>`_. (\ `Source <https://github.com/SERVIR-WA/GALUP/files/7573860/full_phd.pdf>`_\ )

   </p>



* **Classification and Regression Trees (CART)**\ : This model uses binary decision trees to explain predicted values using a sample of training data with already known classifications. Large amount of data is recommended for good results because the branching process for the decision trees, as shown in the Figure below.

   </p>



* **Random Forest Classifier**\ : This is an ensemble learning method that creates a multitude of decision trees and takes the average of the trees for classification, as shown in the Figure below. The RF algorithm can also classify variable importance. Additional information is available `here <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865505002242>`_.

   </p>



* **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier**\ : These are a collection of non-parametric learning algorithms which find the optimal separating hyperplane between classes by focusing on the training data, as shown in the Figure below. Additional information is available `here <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01431160110040323>`_.

   </p>



* **Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC)**\ : This is a general-purpose algorithm that evaluates changes in land cover, land use, or condition over time. The algorithm includes a two-step masking algorithm to eliminate any noisy data caused by snow, clouds, or cloud shadows, as shown in the Figure below. Classification occurs after change is detected in a pixel value.

2. Land Cover Classification Systems
------------------------------------


* The **International Geosphereâ€“Biosphere Programme (IGBP)** is used by the current MODIS Land Cover `Product <https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod12.php>`_. The land cover scheme consists of 17 classes that were decided upon to meet IGBP science projects standards. The scheme considers ground biomass, longevity, and leaf type when creating classes. Additional info: http://www.igbp.net. The following (expandable) outline shows the classification scheme for the IGBP Ecosystems Surface Classifications:

  The **Modified Anderson Level II Land Use/Land Cover Classification System** is used by the US Geological Survey (USGS) to generate National Land Cover Database (NLCD). The Database provides a comprehensive land cover product for the US, that is available for all 50 states and Puerto Rico and updated every 5 years. It is primarily based on Landsat data. Additional information can be obtained at `MRLC <https://www.mrlc.gov/data/legends/national-land-cover-database-2019-nlcd2019-legend>`_.  It consists of 16 classes, as shown in the following outline:

   <summary> <b> RLCM (Class name, Description) </b> </summary>



* **ForÃªt / Forest** - dense, closed canopy formation of evergreen or semi-evergreen broadleaf vegetation with a multiple strata structure that includes scattered emergent trees. Upper stratum of trees over 30 m tall. Understory composed of evergreen or semievergreen shrubs; herbaceous cover is discontinuous.
* **ForÃªt Galerie & Formation Ripicole / Gallery Forest & Riparian Forest** - forest formations forming a band or corridor of dense vegetation along permanent or temporary watercourses; generally closed canopy and similar in structure to forest; their width, extent, and luxuriance depend on the width, and depth of the valleys they follow, as well as the depth and dynamics of the water table. Riparian forest is similar in structure but is found bordering the edges of streams and rivers.
* **ForÃªt DÃ©gradÃ©e / Degraded Forest** - dense, evergreen broadleaf forest with closed or partially closed canopy whose integrity has been degraded by logging or other forms of exploitation. Degraded forest can also be immature forest, or forest in various stages of regrowth after disturbance. Trees 10 to 30 m tall.
* **ForÃªt Claire / Woodland** - open formations of small to medium height trees; tree height over 10 m and tree cover generally between 50 and 75 percent; canopies are often contiguous, with open areas between trees; grass understory can be scattered to dense, often associated with other herbaceous plants.
* **ForÃªt MarÃ©cageuse / Swamp Forest** - open to dense forests associated with temporarily or permanently waterlogged soils; these forests are generally found in natural depressions, seasonally inundated.
* **Plantation** - regular stands of trees planted for the purpose of producing food, beverages, vegetable oils, raw materials for industry, wood, or for protection against wind and water erosion.
* **Mangrove** - coastal forests of stilted shrubs or trees bordering the ocean or coastal estuaries, composed of one or several mangrove species. 
* **FourrÃ© / Thicket** - dense stand of shrubs, often thorny, forming generally impenetrable cover, with minimal or no herbaceous ground cover.
* **Savane / Savanna** - herbaceous vegetation with mainly grasses that generally exceed 80 cm in height; dominated by annual and perennial grasses typically associated with the Sudan and Guinea zones; ground cover often consumed by annual fires; woody vegetation is usually present. The savanna class includes several major types or subclasses, based on density of shrubs and trees; the land use/land cover maps do not distinguish between shrub savanna, tree savanna, and wooded savanna; nevertheless, it is useful to define them:
* **Savane HerbacÃ©e / Herbaceous Savanna** - continuous herbaceous ground cover; trees and shrubs normally absent; this class is represented on the land use / land cover maps.
* **Savane SahÃ©lienne / Sahelian Short Grass Savanna** - scattered trees and shrubs (or only shrubs) with a continuous herbaceous understory usually dominated by annual grasses generally associated with the Sahelian zone; woody cover between 1 and 25 percent.
* **BowÃ©** â€“ flat, open surfaces that generally occur as lateritic plateaus; the skeletal, ferruginous soils form a hardened, impenetrable surface, generally absent of woody vegetation, but supporting varying quantities of herbaceous cover during the rainy season.
* **Steppe** - open, discontinuous herbaceous ground cover, often mixed with shrubs and trees; insufficient cover to carry fire; scattered annual grasses accompanied by widely spaced perennials. 
* **Surfaces Sableuses / Sandy Area** â€“ beach sand or shifting mounds of sand, formed by wind; active dunes.
* **Terrains Rocheux / Rocky Land** - areas of rocky surfaces or outcrops, consisting of rocky peaks, batholiths, talus slopes, crest lines, cliffs, conglomerates, etc.
* **Sols DÃ©nudÃ©s / Bare Soil** - land with little or no vegetation cover, exposing the soil; examples include eroded slopes, gravesl plains, sebkhas, and badlands.
* **Habitations / Settlements** - built up areas comprising human communities in a village, town or city.
* **Zone de Culture / Agriculture** - cultivated areas, with crops dependent on rainfall.
* **Cultures IrriguÃ©es / Irrigated Agriculture** - cultivated areas where crops receive water through an irrigation system to support their growth without relying on rainfall.
* **Cultures des Bas-Fonds et de DÃ©crue / Agriculture in Shallows and Recession** - cultivated areas in depressions or along river banks where crop development occurs as the waters recede during the dry season.
* **Cultures et JachÃ¨res Sous Palmier Ã  Huile / Cropland and Fallow with Oil Palms** - cultivated areas, with scattered oil palms in the fields; crops are mainly dependent on rainfall.
* **CarriÃ¨re / Open Mine** - open pit where rock material is mined
* **Prairie MarÃ©cageuse â€“ VallÃ©e Inondable / Wetland â€“ floodplain** - herbaceous or aquatic vegetation in permanent or semi-permanent wetlands and swamps.
* **Plans Dâ€™eau / Water Bodies** - Any area with permanent or semipermanent surface water.
