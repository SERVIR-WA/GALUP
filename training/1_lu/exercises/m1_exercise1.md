# Module 1 - Exercise 1

## 1. Description

In this exercise, we will visualize the distribution of population by
individual District Assemblies of Ghana in the year 2018 by using a
**Graduated** symbology.

## 2. GIS Dataset

We will use the _shapefile_ named **_Gh\_260\_MMDA.shp_** at
`GALUP-master -> training -> 1_lu -> datasets -> District of Ghana`
to do this exercise.

## 3. Skills Practices

This exercise covers:

- Load GIS data to QGIS Map Canvas,
- Change the symbology of vector layers,
- Create a layout and print a map as a pdf file.

## 4. Instruction

1. Locate _Gh\_260\_MMDA.shp_ in the _Browser Panel_ and add it to
   _Map Canvas_.
2. Open _Attribute Table_ to view the field, _Pop\_2018_, which represents
   population by district in 2018.
3. Choose _Graduated_ symbology and choose the _Reds_ color ramp with 5 classes
   to render the target field: _Pop\_2018_.
4. Add _ESRI Gray (light)_ as the basemap.
5. Create a _Layout_ and then add a _Title_, _Legend_, _Scale bar_, and
   _North Arrow_.
6. Export as a PDF file.

## 5. Result

- Upon completion, the map you got should look similar to this pdf
  [here](https://github.com/SERVIR-WA/GALUP/blob/master/training/1_lu/pdf_maps/PopulationMap.pdf).
- Please go back to
  [Module 1](https://github.com/SERVIR-WA/GALUP/blob/master/training/1_lu/modules/module1.md#4-exercises) to complete the second exercise.
